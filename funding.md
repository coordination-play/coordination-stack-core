## Funding Module 

### Overview 

Coordination-play offers funding tools for an organization to raise funds from investors. It enables coordination between investors and projects enforced by onchain contracts. 

### Motivation 

Many crypto native DAOs and projects that need to raise funds to fund their development are forced into inflexible standard VC contracts that do not fit well with the programmable onchain world. 

We envision a richer set of programmable equyity primitives that allow onchain projects to sell ownership of the project while providing guarantees as much as possible to the investors.    

### Venture stage funding
